# Simple Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This is simple implementation of RPN calculator using Typescript;
Right now project uses STDIN and STDOUT as its interface;

# Run

`npm install`

`ts-node index.js`

## Test

`npm test`

## TODO

1. Pass communication interface as object into class constructor, so other interfaces could be possibly used;
2. Use decorators to validate input/catch errors;
